On the other extreme, we sample randomly record by record and, at each record, we move the parameter. The compromise is to partition the data in a set of batches, compute the average gradient of each batch and at each time update the parameter with the optimisation algorithm. The \"one record at the time\" is the slowest approach, but also is very sensitive to the presence of outliers. The \"take the average of all the data\" approach is faster in running a certain epoch, but it takes longer to converge (i.e. it requires more epochs, the number of times we pass through the whole training data). It also requires more memory, as we need to store the gradients with respect to all records. So, the \"batch\" approach is a good compromise, and we normally set the batch number to a multiplier of the number of threads in the machine performing the training, as this step is often parallelised, and it represents a further parameter that we can cross-validate.

While internally more complex due to the presence of the gates and of several different states (hidden and visible in LSTM), LSTM networks are operationally used exactly in the same ways as the RNN networks described above.","category":"page"},{"location":"04_-_NN_-_Neural_Networks/0401_-_Neural_network_architectures.html","page":"0401 - Neural Networks architectures","title":"0401 - Neural Networks architectures","text":"","category":"page"},{"location":"04_-_NN_-_Neural_Networks/0401_-_Neural_network_architectures.html","page":"0401 - Neural Networks architectures","title":"0401 - Neural Networks architectures","text":"<div id=\"pd_rating_holder_8962705\"></div>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\nPDRTJS_settings_8962705 = {\n\"id\" : \"8962705\",\n\"unique_id\" : \"/home/runner/work/SPMLJ/SPMLJ/lessonsSources/04_-_NN_-_Neural_Networks/0401_-_Neural_network_architectures.md\",\n\"title\" : \"0401_-_Neural_network_architectures.md\",\n\"permalink\" : \"\"\n};\n</script>","category":"page"},{"location":"04_-_NN_-_Neural_Networks/0401_-_Neural_network_architectures.html","page":"0401 - Neural Networks architectures","title":"0401 - Neural Networks architectures","text":"<div class=\"addthis_inline_share_toolbox\"></div>","category":"page"},{"location":"04_-_NN_-_Neural_Networks/0401_-_Neural_network_architectures.html","page":"0401 - Neural Networks architectures","title":"0401 - Neural Networks architectures","text":"","category":"page"},{"location":"04_-_NN_-_Neural_Networks/0401_-_Neural_network_architectures.html","page":"0401 - Neural Networks architectures","title":"0401 - Neural Networks architectures","text":"<script src=\"https://utteranc.es/client.js\"\n        repo=\"sylvaticus/SPMLJ\"\n        issue-term=\"title\"\n        label=\"💬 website_comment\"\n        theme=\"github-dark\"\n        crossorigin=\"anonymous\"\n        async>\n</script>","category":"page"},{"location":"04_-_NN_-_Neural_Networks/0401_-_Neural_network_architectures.html","page":"0401 - Neural Networks architectures","title":"0401 - Neural Networks architectures","text":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"https://polldaddy.com/js/rating/rating.js\"></script>","category":"page"},{"location":"04_-_NN_-_Neural_Networks/0401_-_Neural_network_architectures.html","page":"0401 - Neural Networks architectures","title":"0401 - Neural Networks architectures","text":"<!-- Go to www.addthis.com/dashboard to customize your tools -->\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"//s7.addthis.com/js/300/addthis_widget.js#pubid=ra-6256c971c4f745bc\"></script>","category":"page"},{"location":"02_-_JULIA2_-_Scientific_programming_with_Julia/0202x_EXERCISE-2.1.html#EXERCISE-2.1:-Fitting-the-growth-of-French-forests","page":"EXERCISE 2.1: Fitting the growth of French forests","title":"EXERCISE 2.1: Fitting the growth of French forests","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"02_-_JULIA2_-_Scientific_programming_with_Julia/0202x_EXERCISE-2.1.html","page":"EXERCISE 2.1: Fitting the growth of French forests","title":"EXERCISE 2.1: Fitting the growth of French forests","text":"<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"imgs/forestGrowth.jpg\" alt=\"Forest Growth\" style=\"height:250px;\"> \n<img src=\"imgs/forestGrowthCurves.png\" alt=\"Forest Growth curves\" style=\"height:250px;\"> \n<p>&nbsp;</p>","category":"page"},{"location":"02_-_JULIA2_-_Scientific_programming_with_Julia/0202x_EXERCISE-2.1.html","page":"EXERCISE 2.1: Fitting the growth of French forests","title":"EXERCISE 2.1: Fitting the growth of French forests","text":"How fast are French forests growing?

parts in memory; (3) While stylistically modify function arguments in-place should be limited (as it may lead to hard to find bugs), from a performance point of view it is absolutely fine. If it avoids allocating memory for temporary objects, it may even be faster; (4) The same for the type annotation of function arguments: it may be good to avoid bugs, or required for multiple dispatch, but in general it doesn't improve performances (except in very rare cases when it may help the compiler's type inference))","category":"page"},{"location":"01_-_JULIA1_-_Basic_Julia_programming/0106q_-_QUIZ_1.13.html","page":"Quiz 1.13: Performances, parallel computation","title":"Quiz 1.13: Performances, parallel computation","text":"The correct answers are:","category":"page"},{"location":"01_-_JULIA1_-_Basic_Julia_programming/0106q_-_QUIZ_1.13.html","page":"Quiz 1.13: Performances, parallel computation","title":"Quiz 1.13: Performances, parallel computation","text":"Avoid using non-constant global variables within a function body\nIf the size of an output array is known, preallocate its size and modify each item one at a time rather than start from an empty array and add elements one at a time\nWrite the function in a way that given the types of the arguments, the result is of a fixed type\nAnnotate all the fields of a type with their relevant concrete types","category":"page"},{"location":"01_-_JULIA1_-_Basic_Julia_programming/0106q_-_QUIZ_1.13.html","page":"Quiz 1.13: Performances, parallel computation","title":"Quiz 1.13: Performances, parallel computation","text":"</details>","category":"page"},{"location":"01_-_JULIA1_-_Basic_Julia_programming/0106q_-_QUIZ_1.13.html","page":"Quiz 1.13: Performances, parallel computation","title":"Quiz 1.13: Performances, parallel computation","text":"","category":"page"},{"location":"01_-_JULIA1_-_Basic_Julia_programming/0106q_-_QUIZ_1.13.html#Q2:-Type-stability","page":"Quiz 1.13: Performances, parallel computation","title":"Q2: Type stability","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"01_-_JULIA1_-_Basic_Julia_programming/0106q_-_QUIZ_1.13.html","page":"Quiz 1.13: Performances, parallel computation","title":"Quiz 1.13: Performances, parallel computation","text":"Given the following Julia snippet:","category":"page"},{"location":"01_-_JULIA1_-_Basic_Julia_programming/0106q_-_QUIZ_1.13.html","page":"Quiz 1.13: Performances, parallel computation","title":"Quiz 1.13: Performances, parallel computation","text":"a = Any[\"a\",1,2.5]\nb = [2,3]\nfoo(x) = eltype(x) == Int64 ? 1       : nothing\nboo(x) = eltype(x) == Int64 ? x[1]    : nothing\ngoo(x) = eltype(x) == Int64 ? nothing : 1\nzoo(x) = eltype(x) == Int64 ? nothing : x[1]","category":"page"},{"location":"01_-_JULIA1_-_Basic_Julia_programming/0106q_-_QUIZ_1.13.html","page":"Quiz 1.13: Performances, parallel computation","title":"Quiz 1.13: Performances, parallel computation","text":"Which of the following sentences are correct?","category":"page"},{"location":"01_-_JULIA1_-_Basic_Julia_programming/0106q_-_QUIZ_1.13.html","page":"Quiz 1.13: Performances, parallel computation","title":"Quiz 1.13: Performances, parallel computation","text":"\nchoices = [ # hide\n    \"`foo(a)` is type stable\", # hide\n    \"`foo(b)` is type stable\", # hide\n    \"`boo(a)` is type stable\", # hide\n    \"`boo(b)` is type stable\", # hide\n    \"`goo(a)` is type stable\", # hide\n    \"`goo(b)` is type stable\", # hide\n    \"`zoo(a)` is type stable\", # hide\n    \"`zoo(b)` is type stable\", # hide\n    \"None of the (other) sentences is correct (i.e. all the cases are type instable)\", # hide\n] # hide\nanswers = [1,2,3,4,5,6,8]  # hide\nmultiq(choices, answers;keep_order=true)  # hide\n","category":"page"},{"location":"01_-_JULIA1_-_Basic_Julia_programming/0106q_-_QUIZ_1.13.html","page":"Quiz 1.13: Performances, parallel computation","title":"Quiz 1.13: Performances, parallel computation","text":"<details><summary>RESOLUTION</summary>","category":"page"},{"location":"01_-_JULIA1_-_Basic_Julia_programming/0106q_-_QUIZ_1.13.html","page":"Quiz 1.13: Performances, parallel computation","title":"Quiz 1.13: Performances, parallel computation","text":"The only \"type instable\" function call is zoo(a) because in such a case the compiler doesn't know \"a priori\" the type of the returned output but has to look up the actual type of the first element of a at runtime. Not only the function zoo will not specialise and be slow, but also if there are other functions that depend on the returned value of zoo, the compiler will need extra steps - at run time - to lookup the correct method of these other functions to apply, further slowing down the code. Even if in this example we are working with a single argument, you can \"feel\" how it is the multiple dispatch together with JIT that really makes the difference in Julia: thanks to multiple dispatch we can have multiple JIT compiled versions of the function that specialise to the given inputs. So, for example, when we call bool([2,3]), the JIT compiler will compile a version of boo specific for Vector{Int64}, and hence resolve the condition at compilation time and compile the function returning directly x[1] and hence knowing it will be an Int64 still at compilation time.","category":"page"},{"location":"01_-_JULIA1_-_Basic_Julia_programming/0106q_-_QUIZ_1.13.html","page":"Quiz 1.13: Performances, parallel computation","title":"Quiz 1.13: Performances, parallel computation","text":"The correct answers are:","category":"page"},{"location":"01_-_JULIA1_-_Basic_Julia_programming/0106q_-_QUIZ_1.13.html","page":"Quiz 1.13: Performances, parallel computation","title":"Quiz 1.13: Performances, parallel computation","text":"foo(a) is type stable\nfoo(b) is type stable\nboo(a) is type stable\nboo(b) is type stable\ngoo(a) is type stable\ngoo(b) is type stable\nzoo(b) is type stable","category":"page"},{"location":"01_-_JULIA1_-_Basic_Julia_programming/0106q_-_QUIZ_1.13.html","page":"Quiz 1.13: Performances, parallel computation","title":"Quiz 1.13: Performances, parallel computation","text":"</details>","category":"page"},{"location":"01_-_JULIA1_-_Basic_Julia_programming/0106q_-_QUIZ_1.13.html","page":"Quiz 1.13: Performances, parallel computation","title":"Quiz 1.13: Performances, parallel computation","text":"","category":"page"},{"location":"01_-_JULIA1_-_Basic_Julia_programming/0106q_-_QUIZ_1.13.html#Q3:-Parallel-computation","page":"Quiz 1.13: Performances, parallel computation","title":"Q3: Parallel computation","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"01_-_JULIA1_-_Basic_Julia_programming/0106q_-_QUIZ_1.13.html","page":"Quiz 1.13: Performances, parallel computation","title":"Quiz 1.13: Performances, parallel computation","text":"Which of the following statements regarding parallel computation are correct ?{","category":"page"},{"location":"01_-_JULIA1_-_Basic_Julia_programming/0106q_-_QUIZ_1.13.html","page":"Quiz 1.13: Performances, parallel computation","title":"Quiz 1.13: Performances, parallel computation","text":"\nchoices = [ #

Or the model as a whole must return the same result given the inputs ? ) and how multiple threads complicate the issue. In this exemple we first set in foo() a masterseed, then we use this seed, in combination to the ith of the loop, to reseed the nth-thread rng that will be used in the ith computation. Note that the reseeding is based on the ith of the loop and NOT on the nth of the thread. This guarantees that our stochastic experiment is replicable indipendently from the number of threads used. Also, not only the elements in results are the same, but also their position (order). That is, the tuple (out1,out2) will always be the same across multiple runs of the whole code. However, for how it is written, at each time we call foo() we have a different result. I let to you, as a further exercise, to think how you could modify the code to have always the same result at each call of the function.","category":"page"},{"location":"01_-_JULIA1_-_Basic_Julia_programming/0106q_-_QUIZ_1.13.html","page":"Quiz 1.13: Performances, parallel computation","title":"Quiz 1.13: Performances, parallel computation","text":"The correct answers are:","category":"page"},{"location":"01_-_JULIA1_-_Basic_Julia_programming/0106q_-_QUIZ_1.13.html","page":"Quiz 1.13: Performances, parallel computation","title":"Quiz 1.13: Performances, parallel computation","text":"out1 is different than out2 indipendently to the number of threads used\nWhen the script is run multiple times (in independent Julia sessions) the couple (out1,out2) is the same across the various runs indipendently of the number of threads used in the various attempts","category":"page"},{"location":"01_-_JULIA1_-_Basic_Julia_programming/0106q_-_QUIZ_1.13.html","page":"Quiz 1.13: Performances, parallel computation","title":"Quiz 1.13: Performances, parallel computation","text":"</details>","category":"page"},{"location":"01_-_JULIA1_-_Basic_Julia_programming/0106q_-_QUIZ_1.13.html","page":"Quiz 1.13: Performances, parallel computation","title":"Quiz 1.13: Performances, parallel computation","text":"","category":"page"},{"location":"01_-_JULIA1_-_Basic_Julia_programming/0106q_-_QUIZ_1.13.html","page":"Quiz 1.13: Performances, parallel computation","title":"Quiz 1.13: Performances, parallel computation","text":"<div id=\"pd_rating_holder_8962705\"></div>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\nPDRTJS_settings_8962705 = {\n\"id\" : \"8962705\",\n\"unique_id\" : \"/home/runner/work/SPMLJ/SPMLJ/lessonsSources/01_-_JULIA1_-_Basic_Julia_programming/0106q_-_QUIZ_1.13.md\",\n\"title\" : \"0106q_-_QUIZ_1.13.md\",\n\"permalink\" : \"\"\n};\n</script>","category":"page"},{"location":"01_-_JULIA1_-_Basic_Julia_programming/0106q_-_QUIZ_1.13.html","page":"Quiz 1.13: Performances, parallel computation","title":"Quiz 1.13: Performances, parallel computation","text":"<div class=\"addthis_inline_share_toolbox\"></div>","category":"page"},{"location":"01_-_JULIA1_-_Basic_Julia_programming/0106q_-_QUIZ_1.13.html","page":"Quiz 1.13: Performances, parallel computation","title":"Quiz 1.13: Performances, parallel computation","text":"","category":"page"},{"location":"01_-_JULIA1_-_Basic_Julia_programming/0106q_-_QUIZ_1.13.html","page":"Quiz 1.13: Performances, parallel computation","title":"Quiz 1.13: Performances, parallel computation","text":"<script src=\"https://utteranc.es/client.js\"\n        repo=\"sylvaticus/SPMLJ\"\n        issue-term=\"title\"\n        label=\"💬 website_comment\"\n        theme=\"github-dark\"\n        crossorigin=\"anonymous\"\n        async>\n</script>","category":"page"},{"location":"01_-_JULIA1_-_Basic_Julia_programming/0106q_-_QUIZ_1.13.html","page":"Quiz 1.13: Performances, parallel computation","title":"Quiz 1.13: Performances, parallel computation","text":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"https://polldaddy.com/js/rating/rating.js\"></script>","category":"page"},{"location":"01_-_JULIA1_-_Basic_Julia_programming/0106q_-_QUIZ_1.13.html","page":"Quiz 1.13: Performances, parallel computation","title":"Quiz 1.13: Performances, parallel computation","text":"<!-- Go to www.addthis.com/dashboard to customize your tools -->\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"//s7.addthis.com/js/300/addthis_widget.js#pubid=ra-6256c971c4f745bc\"></script>","category":"page"},{"location":"00_-_INTRO_-_Introduction_julia_ml/0001_-_Course_presentation.html","page":"0001 - Course presentation","title":"0001 - Course presentation","text":"<div id=\"ytb-videos\">\n<span style=font-weight:bold;>Videos related to this segment (click the title to watch)</span>\n<details><summary>00 INTRO - 1A: Course introduction (16:11)</summary>\n<div class=\"container ytb-container\">\n    <div class=\"embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9\">\n        <iframe class=\"embed-responsive-item\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/2tM5oIvOQnU\" allow=\"accelerometer;

The World is modelled as a gridded space inhabited by two groups (in that period racial and segregation questions concerning the cohabitation of \"blacks\" and \"whites\" were topical). Each group has a preference to live in a neighbourhood inhabited by agents of their own type, with a certain \"tolerance\". When the share of agents of its own type in the neighbourhood falls below this \"tolerance\" level, the agent tries to relocate somewhere with a higher share of its own type of agents. The main result of the paper was that even a relatively mild preference for the presence of similar agents would have led to a segregated world and that there was a specific threshold level (between 30% and 40%) that was driving these two completely different outputs, i.e. a \"tipping point\".","category":"page"},{"location":"01_-_JULIA1_-_Basic_Julia_programming/0105x_EXERCISE-1.1.html","page":"EXERCISE 1.1: The Schelling Segregation Model","title":"EXERCISE 1.1: The Schelling Segregation Model","text":"The simulation algorithm then goes in this way: For each step, look at each agent, check if it is \"happy\" with its current location (looking at the share of own types in the neighbourhood), and, if not, relocate the agent to a position where it would be (setting its past location as empty).","category":"page"},{"location":"01_-_JULIA1_-_Basic_Julia_programming/0105x_EXERCISE-1.1.html","page":"EXERCISE 1.1: The Schelling Segregation Model","title":"EXERCISE 1.1: The Schelling Segregation Model","text":"There are various ways of \"generality\" vs \"specificity\" to code the algorithm above.

Indeed even if Foo2 is a submodule of Foo, it doesn't inherit the scope of parent modules. So its code can't find the 'plusOne' function.  When in the REPL we run the command we are in the Main module. Adding using .Foo doesn't change anything, as the problem is in the scope of the Foo2 module, not in those of the REPL (Main - and , of course, typing using Foo looks-up for the package Foo, not the module Foo, and would end in a Package Foo not found error. So what can we do? One solution is using in the plusTwo function the full path of the plusOne function:  plusTwo(x) = Main.Foo.plusOne(x)+1. While this works, it may be a less portable solution, as it then requires module Foo to be a child of Main. Perhaps a better solution is to use a relative path and use the statement using ..Foo in module Foo2 before the definition of plusTwo (trying to use a relative path directly in the function definition as in plusTwo(x) = ..Foo.plusOne(x)+1 would result in a parsing error)","category":"page"},{"location":"00_-_INTRO_-_Introduction_julia_ml/0004q_-_QUIZ_0.1.html","page":"0004q - QUIZ 0.1","title":"0004q - QUIZ 0.1","text":"The correct answers are:","category":"page"},{"location":"00_-_INTRO_-_Introduction_julia_ml/0004q_-_QUIZ_0.1.html","page":"0004q - QUIZ 0.1","title":"0004q - QUIZ 0.1","text":"The result is an error that we can avoid if the function plusTwo in module Foo2 is defined as plusTwo(x) = Main.Foo.plusOne(x)+1\nThe result is an error that we can avoid if in module Foo2 the function plusTwo is preceded by the statement using ..Foo","category":"page"},{"location":"00_-_INTRO_-_Introduction_julia_ml/0004q_-_QUIZ_0.1.html","page":"0004q - QUIZ 0.1","title":"0004q - QUIZ 0.1","text":"</details>","category":"page"},{"location":"00_-_INTRO_-_Introduction_julia_ml/0004q_-_QUIZ_0.1.html","page":"0004q - QUIZ 0.1","title":"0004q - QUIZ 0.1","text":"","category":"page"},{"location":"00_-_INTRO_-_Introduction_julia_ml/0004q_-_QUIZ_0.1.html#Q4:-Submodules2","page":"0004q - QUIZ 0.1","title":"Q4: Submodules2","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"00_-_INTRO_-_Introduction_julia_ml/0004q_-_QUIZ_0.1.html","page":"0004q - QUIZ 0.1","title":"0004q - QUIZ 0.1","text":"Given a module Foo with the following code:","category":"page"},{"location":"00_-_INTRO_-_Introduction_julia_ml/0004q_-_QUIZ_0.1.html","page":"0004q - QUIZ 0.1","title":"0004q - QUIZ 0.1","text":"module Foo\nexport x\nx = 1\nmodule Foo2\n  export plusTwo\n  plusTwo(x) = x+2\nend\nmodule Foo3\n  export plusThree\n  [XXXX]\n  plusThree(x) = plusTwo(x)+1\n  end                  \nend","category":"page"},{"location":"00_-_INTRO_-_Introduction_julia_ml/0004q_-_QUIZ_0.1.html","page":"0004q - QUIZ 0.1","title":"0004q - QUIZ 0.1","text":"Which of the following statements are correct ?","category":"page"},{"location":"00_-_INTRO_-_Introduction_julia_ml/0004q_-_QUIZ_0.1.html","page":"0004q - QUIZ 0.1","title":"0004q - QUIZ 0.1","text":"\nchoices = [ # hide\n  \"`[XXXX]` should be `using Main.Foo.Foo2` for the function `plusThree` to work\", # hide\n  \"`[XXXX]` should be `using Foo2` for the function `plusThree` to work\", # hide\n  \"`[XXXX]` should be `using .Foo2` for the function `plusThree` to work\", # hide\n  \"`[XXXX]` should be `using ..Foo2` for the function `plusThree` to work\", # hide\n  \"`[XXXX]` should be `import Main.Foo.Foo2` for the function `plusThree` to work\", # hide\n  \"`[XXXX]` should be `import Foo2` for the function `plusThree` to work\", # hide\n  \"`[XXXX]` should be `import .Foo2` for the function `plusThree` to work\", # hide\n  \"`[XXXX]` should be `import ..Foo2` for the function `plusThree` to work\", # hide\n  ]  # hide\nanswers = [1,4]  # hide\nmultiq(choices, answers;keep_order=true)  # hide\n","category":"page"},{"location":"00_-_INTRO_-_Introduction_julia_ml/0004q_-_QUIZ_0.1.html","page":"0004q - QUIZ 0.1","title":"0004q - QUIZ 0.1","text":"<details><summary>RESOLUTION</summary>","category":"page"},{"location":"00_-_INTRO_-_Introduction_julia_ml/0004q_-_QUIZ_0.1.html","page":"0004q - QUIZ 0.1","title":"0004q - QUIZ 0.1","text":"The function plusTwo needs to access a function on a sibling module.

Still, we could end up with a perceptron classifier like in figure (a), very dependent on noisy data and that doesn't generalise well. Support Vector Machines (SVM, which we will not develop further in this course except in this small discussion) are linear classifiers that try to maximise the boundary with the classified data. So here we enter the realm of \"optimisation\", usually achieved employing a gradient-based approach that we'll see when discussing neural networks: it is no longer indifferent one classifier that separates the data from another, but SVM (should) retrieve the classifier that is more \"far away\" from the two datasets, on both the directions (figure (b)). The second important characteristic of SVM is that this optimisation can be \"adjusted\" to consider not only the points that lie closest to the decision surface (the \"support vectors\", from which the name..) but rather to give importance to the points that are farther away from the boundary. This adjustment takes the form of a regularisation parameter that can try to optimize with the cross-validation technique above. So, in the figure example, we intuitively see that the third classifier ( figure (c) ) would be the best for our dataset, it will better match with the nature of our data, even if it would make some classification mistakes, and we can steer an SVM algorithm toward the one depicted on figure (c) by increasing its regularisation parameter.","category":"page"},{"location":"03_-_ML1_-_Introduction_to_Machine_Learning/0301_-_Machine_learning_main_concepts.html#Using-linear-classifiers-for-non-linear-classification","page":"0301 - Machine Learning -  main concepts","title":"Using linear classifiers for non-linear classification","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"03_-_ML1_-_Introduction_to_Machine_Learning/0301_-_Machine_learning_main_concepts.html","page":"0301 - Machine Learning -  main concepts","title":"0301 - Machine Learning -  main concepts","text":"Often the relationship between the X and the Y is not linear in nature, and even employing the best linear classifier would result in significant classification errors (same for regressions).
